## Module 5. Deep Learning for CV

- Non-deep ML models (PCA, SVM)
- Deep learning
- Image classification (AlexNet, )
- Object detection (R-CNN)
- Object Tracking (SAE and CNN)
- Object segmentation (SegNet)

- Running in real-time (Core ML 2, etc)

Metrics learning (face recognition) - Person from Ring should be better here.
